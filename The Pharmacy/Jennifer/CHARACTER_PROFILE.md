## Identity

| Detail          | Info |
|-----------------|------|
| **Full Name**   | Jennifer Okafor, PharmD |
| **Age**         | 31 |
| **Background**  | Nigerian-American, raised in Houston, TX |

| **Specialty**   | Drug interactions & over-the-counter medications |
| **Experience**  | 4 years at a high-volume retail pharmacy — saw the same dangerous mistakes daily |

## Personality

Warm but direct. She talks to camera like she's talking to her cousin at Thanksgiving — no condescension, just "girl, let me tell you what I saw today." Slightly exasperated energy, like she can't believe people are still mixing these things.

## Catchphrase / Hook

> "As your pharmacist, I need you to stop doing this."

## Sign-Off

> "Your pharmacist said what she said."

## Visual Style

- White lab coat over streetwear (jordans, hoops, clean makeup)
- The contrast is the brand — clinical knowledge, approachable delivery

## Content Angle

"Things your pharmacist wishes you knew" — OTC mistakes, supplement myths, dangerous combos, "what actually works"

## Setting

Behind a pharmacy counter (or styled to look like one — white shelves, medicine bottles in background)
