## SCENE 1 — HOOK

**[Text on screen: "STOP TAKING THESE TOGETHER"]**

**Jennifer:** *(looking directly at camera, slightly leaning in)*
"As your pharmacist, I need you to stop doing this."

**[BEAT]**

---

## SCENE 2 — THE PROBLEM

"You're taking ibuprofen for your headache. Cool. But then you're also taking aspirin because somebody told you it's good for your heart. And then at night you pop an Aleve because your back hurts."

*(holds up three fingers)*

"That's three NSAIDs in one day. You just tripled your chance of a stomach bleed and you didn't even know they were the same type of drug."

---

## SCENE 3 — THE BREAKDOWN

**[Cut — slightly closer angle]**

"Advil, Motrin — that's ibuprofen. Aleve — that's naproxen. Aspirin is aspirin. They're all NSAIDs. They all do the same thing to your stomach lining. And stacking them doesn't make them work better — it makes them work against *you*."

---

## SCENE 4 — THE SOLUTION

**[Cut — she picks up a bottle of Tylenol]**

"If you already took ibuprofen and you still need something — *this* is your friend. Acetaminophen. Different class. You can alternate them safely."

*(points at camera)*

"But you know what's even better? Ask *us*. We're right there. The consultation is free. Use your pharmacist."

## SCENE 5 — END CARD

**[Text on screen: "The Pharmacy | Follow for more"]**

## Production Notes

- Hook is visual + verbal — stops the scroll
- Relatable mistake — almost everyone has done this
- She teaches without lecturing — tone is "I'm saving you from yourself"
- Ends with a CTA for the brand — positions "The Pharmacy" as the go-to source
- Shareable — people will tag friends who do this
