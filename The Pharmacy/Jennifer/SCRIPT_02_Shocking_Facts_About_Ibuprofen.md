# Script 02 — "Shocking Facts About Ibuprofen"

**Character:** Jennifer Okafor
**Format:** Talking head, 60-90 seconds, vertical video
**Setting:** Behind the pharmacy counter, white coat over streetwear
**Tone:** Escalating shock value — each fact hits harder than the last

---

## SCENE 1 — HOOK

**[Text on screen: "WHAT IBUPROFEN ACTUALLY DOES TO YOUR BODY"]**

**Jennifer:** *(dead stare into camera)*
"You pop ibuprofen like it's candy. Let's talk about what it's actually doing."

---

## SCENE 2 — FACT #1: STOMACH DAMAGE

**[Text on screen: "#1"]**

"Ibuprofen starts damaging your stomach lining within *one single dose*. Not after weeks. Not after months. One pill and the erosion starts. Your stomach literally can't tell the difference between the pill and an attack on its own tissue."

---

## SCENE 3 — FACT #2: KILLS RECOVERY

**[Cut — she leans on the counter]**
**[Text on screen: "#2"]**

"If you take ibuprofen before or after a workout, you're slowing down your own recovery. That inflammation you're trying to kill? That IS the healing process. You're telling your muscles to stop repairing themselves."

---

## SCENE 4 — FACT #3: HEART ATTACK RISK

**[Cut — closer angle, she picks up a bottle]**
**[Text on screen: "#3"]**

"Ibuprofen raises your risk of a heart attack by 31 percent — and that spike starts in the *first week* of regular use. Not years. The first week. This was a study of over 400,000 people. This is not a maybe."

## SCENE 5 — FACT #4: KIDNEY FAILURE

**[Cut — she puts the bottle down slowly]**
**[Text on screen: "#4"]**

"It can cause kidney failure. Your kidneys need blood flow to filter properly. Ibuprofen reduces blood flow to your kidneys. Take it while you're dehydrated — like after a night out, after a long flight, after a workout — and you're basically suffocating your kidneys."

---

## SCENE 6 — FACT #5: TESTOSTERONE (THE VIRAL MOMENT)

**[Cut — she looks off camera then back, shaking her head]**
**[Text on screen: "#5"]**

"And this is the one nobody talks about. Ibuprofen lowers your testosterone. In men, consistent use was linked to a hormonal condition called compensated hypogonadism. Basically your body has to work overtime just to keep your testosterone at a normal level — and eventually it can't keep up."

---

## SCENE 7 — THE CLOSE

**[Cut — she crosses her arms]**

"And you wanna know the worst part? Most of you are taking it for things that don't even need it. A mild headache. Soreness after sitting at a desk all day. Stuff that water, movement, and sleep would fix."

*(leans into camera)*

"I'm not saying never take it. I'm saying stop treating it like a vitamin. It's a *drug*. Respect it like one."

## SCENE 8 — SIGN-OFF & END CARD

**[She taps the counter twice]**

"Your pharmacist said what she said."

## Production Notes

- Text overlays on each fact number keep people watching — creates a checklist effect, viewers want to see all 5
- The escalation matters — stomach is known, heart attack is alarming, kidney failure is scary, testosterone is the viral moment (especially for male audiences who share ibuprofen casually)
- "Your pharmacist said what she said" — signature sign-off, builds her brand within the brand
- Predicted comment section gold: "Wait the testosterone one is REAL??" — that's where engagement explodes
