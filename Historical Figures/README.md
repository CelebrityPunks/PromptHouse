# Historical Figures — Brought to Life

AI-generated videos of historical figures using their real photographs and documented words. Creating content that has never existed — giving voices and motion to people the world only knows through still images.

## Pipeline

1. **Image** — Source real historical photos (Library of Congress, Smithsonian, Wikimedia Commons — public domain)
2. **Voice** — Generate voiceover with MiniMax or ElevenLabs (match era, accent, tone)
3. **Video** — Combine image + voice with InfiniteTalk (RunPod)

## Content Formats

- **"First ever video of [person]"** — standalone viral clips
- **"If [person] had YouTube"** — explaining their work like a modern creator
- **"Last words of [person]"** — actual documented final statements
- **"Voices of the forgotten"** — unnamed historical people given a voice
